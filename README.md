Colours and smiles V0.2
=======================
A Colors and styles navigation tool for support
-----------------------------------------------

### Background
It can be slow to navigate Colors and styles to try find the option that corresponds to a certain element on a webpage.  Using CSS to override the current rules is problematic as it can break after upgrades, and is difficult to maintain.  Colours and smiles is a point-and-click Chrome extension that tells you where to find the rules for an element in Colors and styles. 

### Installation
* Download coloursAndSmiles.crx
* In Google Chrome, type chrome://extensions into the adress bar
* Drag coloursAndSmiles.crx onto the Extensions page
* Click Add extension

### Usage
* Go to a Wild Apricot site
* Click the Apricot logo in the upper-right hand corner of the screen
* Hover over the element you want Colors and styles information on and right click
* **Do not move the cursor** - the tool will give you information for whatever is under your mouse when the context menu option is selected 
* Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to select Colours and smiles from the context menu  
* Hit the enter key
* Hit Shift+Ctrl+J (Cmd+Opt+J on a Mac)
* Expand the Colours and Smiles object and then expand your theme
* If a theme does not show up, there are no Colors and styles options for it

### Things to look forward to in the next release
* A better way to specify theme (maybe even automatic detection)
* A more user-friendly way to display results (maybe push them to the info menu)

###CSSViewer 1.4 
was created by GitHub user *miled* and is available at https://github.com/miled/cssviewer. *miled* adapted the extension from work done by *Nicolas Huon* as a [FireFox addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2104), but unfortunately, the original code source comes with NO SPECIFIC LICENSE or COPYRIGHT.

*miled* attempted to contact Nicolas to ask for permission but to no avail, furthermore, the FireFox add-on seems abandoned since June 2008. Believing that *CSSViewer* is a great resource for web developers and web designers alike, *miled* made a CSSViewer port to Google Chrome on March 2010, and on February 2013, *miled* decided to release the code under the terms of the **[GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt)** (GPLv2), so *Nicolas Huon*'s original work would benefit the whole world and remain free.
